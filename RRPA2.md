The Weather Events Analysis
========================================================

This project try to answer two questions:
* Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the `EVTYPE` variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
* Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

The other detail about the project can be found on Coursera website.

#  Data Processing 
The raw data can't be read into R completly, the `REMARK` variable is too big to cotains in one column, so, I 
just read a part of row. I load just 7 variable which is `EVTYPE`,`FATALITIES`,`INJURIES`,`PROPDMG`,`PROPDMGEXP`,`CROPDMG` and `CROPDMGEXP`
